## Intellectual justification:  

The intellectual motivation behind this project focuses on addressing the intersecting challenges of urban accessibility and environmental justice within Vancouver. By creating an accessibility map that helps to illustrate TransLink bus routes onto green spaces, we aim to highlight areas with inadequate access to nature, particularly amongst marginalized communities. Building upon established basic urban planning principles and web cartography methodologies learnt in GEOS 472, this initiative works as a call to action with insights that can be utilized towards future development plans and for planners to reference when looking to strategically implement green space based on spatial distribution - fostering a more inclusive and sustainable urban environment. Ultimately, this project represents a vital step towards fostering equitable accessibility to green spaces.

## Research question(s):  
A clear statement of the question(s) you hope to address (or pose for the reader) in some fashion.

## Data Sources (Tentative):  

[Real-time Transit Information (RTTI)-Translink API](https://www.translink.ca/about-us/doing-business-with-translink/app-developer-resources/rtti)
[LiDAR 2022](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2022/information/)
[Greenways](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/greenways/information/?location=14,49.25169,-123.13447)
[Parks](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parks-polygon-representation/map/?location=13,49.2524,-123.11717)
[Non-Market Housing](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/non-market-housing/map/?location=14,49.25613,-123.11747)
## Potential maps and geographical visualizations:  
What might you visualize? Why? How? What role for interactivity?

## Coding:  
Reflect on how and why you plan to make good and relevant use of coding. Are there new features or libraries you might want to try out?

**Questions:  Focused questions you have for me and/or for yourselves moving forward!**

## Cooperation:  
It is crucial that you think about and offer us a plan for how the group will work together. Consider articulating an initial division of labour (mixed with cooperation, I do hope!) among the group that is equitable. Such a plan should detail how  _**each**_  group member will demonstrate how they have learned the material of the course and can apply it. We will be reflecting back on these statements as your work moves forward.
